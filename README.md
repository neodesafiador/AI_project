# AI Project - *Hand Gesture Recognition*

Group members: **Quang Dang, Katsuki Oike**

## Overview
After working together, we decided that our project would be **Hand Gesture Recognition**, a combination of the two previous ideas: Headball and Air Canvas. We will dive deeper into how machines can learn to recognize hand gestures, with the aim of implementing this technology to play some simple games. 

## Milestones

- [ ] **Understand the process behind hand tracking**
- [ ] **Implement Hand Gesture Recognition into an application**

## MediaPipe's Machine Learning Pipeline for Hand Gesture Recognition
Machine Learning Pipeline for Hand Gesture Recognition is a cross-platform, open-source pipeline that can be used to detect and recognize hand gestures in real time. According to our group's research, it is a multi-stage pipeline that consists of the following steps:
- [Preprocessing](# Preprocessing)
- [Hand detection](# Hand detection)
- [Hand landmark detection](# Hand landmark detection)
- [Gesture recognition](# Gesture recognition)

### Preprocessing
### Hand detection
### Hand landmark detection
### Gesture recognition
