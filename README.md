# AI Project - *Hand Gesture Recognition*

Group members: **Quang Dang, Katsuki Oike**

## Overview
After working together, we decided that our project would be **Hand Gesture Recognition**, a combination of the two previous ideas: Headball and Air Canvas. We will dive deeper into how machines can learn to recognize hand gestures, with the aim of implementing this technology to play some simple games. 

## Milestones

- [ ] **Understand the process behind hand tracking**
- [ ] **Implement Hand Gesture Recognition into an application**
